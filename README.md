# Yarnabase
Yarn excel manager 

Copyright Orsek 2024.

Welcome to Yarnabase!
This is an Excel spreadsheet macro, that can easily help you keep track of your yarn/stash!
To get started, download the easy setup, or download the YB Macro file if you REALLY KNOW what you are doing. The YB Macro file is only for developers, and skilled coders.

In the excel spreadsheet download, go to the developer tab once you open it, and click macros. After that, you can click yarnabase and click run!
Or you could use the shortcut (not tested) and that is CTRL+SHIFT+V.
To unblock Yarnabase, (it thinks it is a virus) follow this website. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/a-potentially-dangerous-macro-has-been-blocked-0952faa0-37e7-4316-b61d-5b5ed6024216
